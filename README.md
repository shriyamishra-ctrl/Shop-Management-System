# Shop-Management-System
ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT 
 
 
INTRODUCTION: 
 
Online shopping is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods or services from a seller 
in real-time, without an intermediary service, over the Internet. It is a form of electronic 
commerce. This project is an attempt to provide the advantages of online shopping to 
customers of a local shop.  
 
OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT: 
 
Finding an application that is helpful for small shops and making their products available 
online. This application allows customers to easily order products online from home and the 
owners of shopkeepers can easily maintain a record of the stock left, online orders, and 
expenses/cash. 
 
Talking about the features of the management system, the system consists of two different 
portals - one for the ADMINISTRATOR and the other for the CUSTOMER. The Administrator 
has the functionality to add product, display modify, remove and queueing the list. 
For the users to buy products online, he/she can easily order at the ease of home during this 
pandemic or even in future.
